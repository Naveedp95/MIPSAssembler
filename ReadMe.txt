How to use the program:

1) Create a input text file named "InstructionRead.txt" in the same directory as MARS.

2) Input a few lines of MIPS Assembly language instructions and save.

3) Once you run the program, a successfull compilation will play a sound and a output file
   with the results will be created in the same directory as your MARS. It will be called "Output.txt".
	*Main program is named "Assembler-Eric"
Features of the Program:

1) Reads a text file full of MIPS assembly instruction

2) Parses each statement from the Text file into a token

3) Generates a machine code for R and I format 

4) Outputs the machine code as a string, to a text file that was created

5) Upon successful compilation plays a sound

Limitations of the Program:

1) Does not do J format

2) The i format is limited to non immediates
